DinoReports aims to make it easy to extract information directly from reports by harnessing LLMsâ€™ ability to understand plain English (and other languages) with a simple CALL. Yes, we are talking about good old COBOL applications.

Why add this technology to COBOL? Because it makes sense. Over time, this approach could extend into every part of an application, not just reports. The interface is easy to use and integrate, enabling data-entry solutions with AI-powered suggestions, grammar corrections, automatic classification, and much more.
